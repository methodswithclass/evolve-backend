				Welcome to the Feedback Demonstration Walkthrough<br><br><br><br>



				These examples are intended to show how evolutionary algorithms work in a non-technical way<br><br>

				This walkthrough will guide you through how to use this example<br><br>

				Learn how to evolve new generations, watch the evolution happen in real-time, and be more aware of what you're seeing happening<br><br><br><br>


				You will see with this walkthrough: 
				<ul>
					<li>
						"OK" buttons
					</li>
					<li>
						information popups
					</li>
					<li>
						animating buttons
					</li>
					<li>
						automatic screen scrolling
					</li>
					<li>
						a complete button
					</li>
				</ul>

				<br>

				The demo, without the walkthrough, functions exactly the same, but is bare. You may start it again at any time by clicking the "W" button located in the upper-right area of the page<br><br>


				Reading the little bit of information provided all throughout this site will allow for the best experience overall<br><br>

				<br><br><br>

				Future work:<br>This site (obvious pun-intended) is an ever-evolving project<br>including the current more robust and informative Trash Pickup example, come back soon for more examples of evolutionary algorithms :)
