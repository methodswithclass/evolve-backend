				Welcome to the Trash Pickup Demonstration Walkthrough<br><br><br><br>



				These examples are intended to show how evolutionary algorithms work in a non-technical way<br><br>

				This walkthrough will guide you through how to use this example<br><br>

				Learn how to evolve new generations, run simulations, and refresh the trash grid<br><br><br><br>


				You will see with this walkthrough: 
				<ul>
					<li>
						"OK" buttons
					</li>
					<li>
						information popups
					</li>
					<li>
						animating buttons
					</li>
					<li>
						automatic screen scrolling
					</li>
					<li>
						a complete button
					</li>
				</ul>

				<br>

				The demo, without the walkthrough, functions exactly the same, but is bare. You may start it again at any time by clicking the "W" button located in the upper-right area of the page<br><br>


				Reading the little bit of information provided all throughout this site will allow for the best experience overall<br><br>

				<br><br><br>

				Future work:<br>This page (along with the site as a whole) (obvious pun-intended) is an ever-evolving project<br>come back soon for the walkthrough for the settings panel (located on the right side of the page) that helps change the intelligence of your robot
